To compile:
    1. Set class path. If using the provided lib folder structure, just replace the LIBDIR value in setclasspath
        and type 'source setclasspath'
    2. make 

Note:
   Something to do with the DFA construction seems to take way too long right now.
   Should compile, but if it doesn't, try increasing the conversion timeout parameter in the make file
